# API
Example of API Automation code with REST Assured, Java, Maven and TestNG

Following project is a basic example of API testing using REST Assured, Java, Maven and TestNG.
Using AWS API Gateway I created simple API of pet store.

There are 2 tests in the project;

Test 1 - makes a GET call to basic API and asserts default view and content (3 animals with id,tytle and price)	

Test 2 - creates A POST call to add new animal to the Pet store API and asserts success of the operation (200 status code) 
          and content of the output.
          
This project is created using only open source tools by Oleksii Liulka.

Have a good day.
